# Team To-Do Web App – Self-Learning Project

## 1. Project Overview

This is a **self-initiated learning project** I created to practice working like an IT Project Manager.

The idea: a simple web application where a small team can create, track, and complete tasks in one place.

I did not develop the code myself. My focus in this project is on the **project management side**: requirements, backlog, planning, basic documentation, and delivery approach.

---

## 2. My Role

**Role:** Project Manager (learning project)

I used this project to practice how I would:
- Clarify the problem and goals
- Write basic requirements and user stories
- Plan and structure the work into small deliverables
- Think about testing, feedback, and releases

---

## 3. Problem & Goal

**Problem:** Teams often track tasks in many different places (chat, notes, memory), which leads to missed deadlines and confusion.

**Goal:** Design a simple solution where:
- Each task has an owner, due date, and status
- The team can see what is "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done"
- It is easy to update tasks as work moves forward

---

## 4. Scope

### In Scope
- Simple web interface for creating and viewing tasks
- Basic fields: title, description, assignee, due date, status
- Simple filters (e.g. by status)

### Out of Scope (for now)
- Mobile app
- Advanced reporting or analytics
- Integrations with email, Slack, etc.

---

## 5. Requirements & User Stories

I drafted the requirements and user stories in a separate document.

Examples of user stories:

- **US-01**: As a team member, I want to create a task with a title and due date so I don’t forget it.
- **US-02**: As a team member, I want to change the status of a task to “Done” so that the team can see it is completed.
- **US-03**: As a team lead, I want to see all tasks by status so I can understand overall progress.
- **US-04**: As a team member, I want to edit a task if details change so that information stays up-to-date.

(These are stored in [`requirements/user-stories.md`](./requirements/user-stories.md) – to be added.)

---

## 6. Planning Approach

For this learning project, I assumed the work would be delivered in **two short sprints**:

- **Sprint 1** – Basic task creation and list view
- **Sprint 2** – Editing tasks, changing status, basic filtering

For each sprint, I defined:
- A simple sprint goal
- Which user stories belong to the sprint
- A short review of what was “delivered” and what I would improve next time

(Planned sprint breakdown in [`planning/sprint-plan.md`](./planning/sprint-plan.md) – to be added.)

---

## 7. Testing & UAT

Even though this is a learning project, I prepared:

- A simple **test checklist** (can a user create, edit, and complete a task?)
- A draft **UAT scenario**: how I would ask a small group of users to try the app and give feedback

(Details in [`uat/testing-checklist.md`](./uat/testing-checklist.md) – to be added.)

---

## 8. Tools Used

For this project, I focused on simple tools I can access easily:

- **Google Sheets / Docs** – to structure backlog and requirements
- **GitHub** – to store project documentation and make it visible
- (Optional in future) Jira or Trello – to manage a more realistic digital board

---

## 9. What I Practiced as a Project Manager

Through this project I practiced:

- Turning a vague idea into a clear **problem statement** and **goals**
- Writing **user stories** with acceptance criteria
- Planning work into **sprints** with goals and scope
- Thinking about **testing** and **user acceptance**, not only building
- Documenting everything clearly so that someone else could understand the project quickly

---

## 10. Next Steps

In the future, I plan to:

- Connect this documentation with a simple real web app (for example, a basic To-Do app deployed by a developer or from a template)
- Add screenshots of a Kanban board showing “To Do / In Progress / Done”
- Expand the project with one or two additional features based on feedback

---

## 11. Notes

This is a **learning project** created alongside my transition from general project management to **IT / digital project management**. My goal is to show how I think, structure work, and communicate as a project manager, even when I am not the person writing the code.
